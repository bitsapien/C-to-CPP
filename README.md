This is a program written for learing purposes.
So it may work awesomely or may be heavily broken.

It essentaily is used to convert a program written in the C language to the C++ language.

The concept is simple but the implementaion was suprisingly INSANELY tough !

Feel free to try and improve the code. A lot of scope for improvement is there too !
